        <p style="word-wrap: break-word; word-spacing: 0.2rem;">In a country where education is held in very high esteem and the teacher is equated to God, we at Rajalakshmi Engineering College have dedicated ourselves to impart education and develop the student to be a responsible engineer and individual.
            Students of Rajalakshmi Engineering College are groomed carefully and the virtues of hard work, discipline and ethical practices in profession are imbibed in them constantly during their campus life.
            Campus life here stresses the importance of extra academic activities apart from academic learning, leading them to many new avenues. All these go a long way in making our student a thoroughbred professional, eminently suited to contribute in his chosen career with an ever open mind for new thoughts and ideas in industrial and technological advancements.
            We are hence confident that our students equipped with such capabilities will emerge as valuable contributory assets to the development of the organizations they serve as well as to the nation.</p>
