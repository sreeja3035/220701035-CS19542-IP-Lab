Starting his career as a Lecturer in the Electrical & Electronics Engineering Department of REC, in the year 1998, he carved a niche for himself as an exemplary teacher with a passion for making the students employable by the Industry. He is currently an Assistant Professor in the Department. Working along senior Professors, he played a key role in the conceptualization and design of a path breaking program called "Residential Employability Training Camp". The roll out of this program led to a phenomenal increase in the number of students placed in Campus Recruitments.
